            <h2>The ugly</h2>
            <p class="grid-p-text">As great as the internet of things movement sounds, there are unfortunately a lot of problems surrounding an individual’s right to privacy and the data that is being collected.</p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p class="grid-p-text">Kaspersky, a security company has identified that attacks on smart devices had increased drastically in 2018. [9] Sensors in devices such as cameras and microphones can easily be hacked if the correct security measures are not in place. This leads to an uncomfortable level of privacy invasion, and as the number of smart devices increase, so does the number of things that can be exploited. This leaves people and their belongings in a constantly vunerable state which is something that no one should experience.</p>

            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p class="grid-p-text">Data privacy is also an underlying issue. For the "internet of things" world to function effectively, more people must be open to sharing information with first and third party sources. This is a huge legal grey area in some countries and new laws must be enforced to control this mass collection of user information. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU is said to be “the most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years” and will remould the way in which data is handled across every sector. [9] The problem lies when you begin to understand that soon, we won’t have a choice. As old appliances and consumer products slowly phase out, new “smart” replacements will be the only choice. “Dumb” products won’t be available anymore, forcing users into an ecosystem where everything is monitored and tracked, raising anxiety and people slowly losing their freedom.</p>
