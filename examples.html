            <h2>Home Automation.</h2>
            <p class="grid-p-text">One of the biggest markets for internet of things devices is home automation. Amazon and Google are currently the biggest players in the game right now with their smart assistants. These play the role as a central point where other child devices may connect to. [4] Using a combination of thermostats, security cameras, smart bulbs, doorbells and door locks, it has become very easy for the average consumer to turn their “dumb” home into a smart one. These devices are often advertised to improve the convenience of a working homeowner.</p>
            <p class="grid-p-text">The complexity of operations can vary significantly. A simple example would be using an internet connected smart plug and scheduling times in the day for the socket to receive power. You could also set your bathroom smart lights to adjust the bulbs colour temperature depending on the time of day. In the morning it would be a cool white colour whereas in the night it will be a much warmer tone to prevent eye strain. A more complex idea would be creating a morning routine. Your smart alarm clock could automatically notify your coffee machine, garage door and car that you are now out of bed. The coffee machine will make your favourite beverage whilst your garage door opens which then notifies your car to reverse out. The possibilities are truly endless.</p>

            <h2>Smarter Cities</h2>
            <p class="grid-p-text">According to Pike Research on Smart Cities, the market is said to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars by the year 2020.</p>
            <p class="grid-p-text"> There are various sectors which include “Smart Environment”, “Smart Mobility”, “Smart Governance” and many key services and industries. [5] So far this market has not taken off whether that be for financial, political and/or technical reasons. However, this is slowly changing in wealthier areas of the world such as District One. This is a newly built residential complex in the Arab Emirates which prioritizes the use of technology as the foundation for the city. [6]</p>
            <h2>In a smart city, many variables can be constantly monitored. </h2>
            <p class="grid-p-text">Air Quality is something that can be constantly monitored using pollution sensors. These can be deployed across an entire city where all the data is made publicly available. Not only does this raise awareness of pollutant problems that may arise but can provide motivation for individuals to improve their lifestyle positively which will in turn benefit the environment. Fitness applications designed for running, can combine this information with GPS data to find optimal running routes with the most oxygen, this is a strong health benefit if they lived in a particularly busy city. [8]</p>
            <p class="grid-p-text">Dealing with traffic congestion is also a hot topic when looking at the future of cities. As more and more cars join the road, congestion will only get higher and new solutions need to be found. “Big Data” can be collected from CCTV feeds that are already deployed in urban cities as well as GPS tracking data from individual cars. Once again combining this information, with for example the hours of the day, can help identify patterns. Smart traffic lights can also be used to detect when a road is empty and keep the lights green until they are required. Not only is this easing congestion, but also contributes to less greenhouse gases being released from stop-start driving that is typical in urban areas. Sensors and cameras can also detect accidents and communicate this information to nearby emergency services without the need for human intervention. This technology could save lives. [7]</p>
